# Patel Platform Service Template (PPST)

A production-oriented backend application template built with **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **Clean Architecture**.

PPST provides a reusable engineering foundation that enables developers to build consistent, maintainable, and scalable backend services without repeatedly solving the same infrastructure problems.

Instead of rebuilding project structure, dependency injection, logging, exception handling, configuration, testing, and architectural patterns for every new project, PPST provides these capabilities out of the box so developers can focus on implementing business logic.

# 1. Introduction

Patel Platform Service Template (PPST) is a reusable backend application template designed to standardize software architecture across every backend service in the Patel Engineering ecosystem.

Rather than serving as a simple CRUD starter project, PPST provides a production-oriented engineering foundation that encourages consistency, maintainability, scalability, and clean separation of responsibilities.

The template already includes the common infrastructure required by modern backend services, allowing developers to spend their time solving business problems instead of rebuilding the same technical foundation.

PPST currently includes:

- Clean Architecture
- Layered Design
- Dependency Injection
- Repository Pattern
- SQLAlchemy Integration
- Configuration Management
- Structured Logging
- Global Exception Handling
- Standardized API Contracts
- Unit Testing
- Extensible Project Structure

Every future backend service should inherit this template and customize only its business domain.

---

# 2. Why PPST Exists

As organizations build more backend services, projects often begin to drift apart.

Different developers make different architectural decisions, resulting in inconsistent folder structures, coding styles, logging strategies, testing approaches, dependency management, and error handling.

Over time, this inconsistency creates unnecessary complexity.

Instead of maintaining one engineering standard, every project becomes its own unique system that developers must learn independently.

Typical problems include:

- Different folder structures
- Different logging implementations
- Different exception handling
- Different testing strategies
- Different configuration approaches
- Duplicated infrastructure code
- Inconsistent API responses
- Difficult onboarding for new developers

PPST solves these problems by providing one consistent engineering foundation that every backend service shares.

Instead of reinventing infrastructure for every project, developers inherit a proven architecture and focus only on implementing business requirements.

This approach improves:

- Maintainability
- Readability
- Scalability
- Developer productivity
- Team collaboration
- Long-term consistency

The result is a collection of backend services that all look, behave, and evolve in a predictable manner.

# 3. Design Philosophy

PPST is built around one simple philosophy:

> **Infrastructure should remain stable. Business logic should evolve.**

The architecture should not change every time a new backend service is created.

Instead, only the business domain should change.

When creating a new service, developers typically replace:

- Domain models
- Business rules
- Application use cases
- Repository implementations
- API contracts

Everything else should remain consistent.

This includes:

- Project structure
- Dependency Injection
- Logging
- Configuration
- Exception handling
- Testing
- Middleware
- Startup process

This philosophy creates systems that are predictable, reusable, and easier to maintain over time.

PPST follows several well-established software engineering principles:

### Separation of Concerns (SoC)

Every layer should solve one specific problem.

Responsibilities are separated so that changes in one part of the application have minimal impact on the rest of the system.

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Every module, class, and layer should have one primary responsibility.

This improves readability, maintainability, and testing.

### Clean Architecture

Business rules should remain independent of frameworks, databases, and external technologies.

Frameworks may change.

Business rules should not.

### Dependency Inversion

High-level application logic should depend on abstractions rather than implementation details.

This makes components easier to replace and test.

### Composition over Duplication

Instead of copying infrastructure into every project, services reuse the same architectural foundation and compose new business functionality on top of it.

# 4. Engineering Principles

Every backend service built using PPST should follow the same engineering rules.

These principles keep the codebase consistent and maintainable as the platform grows.

## One Responsibility Per Layer

Every architectural layer exists for one purpose.

Routes process HTTP requests.

Application services coordinate workflows.

The domain contains business rules.

Infrastructure communicates with external systems.

Responsibilities should never overlap.

---

## Keep Business Logic Out of Routes

API routes should remain thin.

Their responsibilities are limited to:

- Receiving requests
- Validating input
- Resolving dependencies
- Calling application services
- Returning responses

Routes should never make business decisions.

---

## Business Rules Belong to the Domain

Business policies belong inside the domain layer.

Examples include:

- Inventory thresholds
- Discount calculations
- Validation policies
- Pricing rules
- Approval logic

The domain should remain independent of FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, databases, and external services.

---

## Services Coordinate Workflows

Application services orchestrate use cases.

They determine:

- Which repositories to call
- Which domain rules to execute
- Which response contracts to return

Services coordinate the application.

They do not directly manage HTTP requests or database implementation details.

---

## Infrastructure Handles External Systems

Infrastructure communicates with technologies outside the application.

Examples include:

- Databases
- Logging
- Cache
- Messaging
- File Storage
- External APIs

Infrastructure should never contain business rules.

---

## Centralize Configuration

Configuration values should have a single source of truth.

Environment variables should be loaded into a centralized configuration object and shared across the application.

Hardcoded configuration values should be avoided whenever possible.

---

## Use Dependency Injection

Application components should receive their dependencies instead of creating them directly.

Dependency Injection reduces coupling and improves testing by making components easier to replace.

---

## Test Business Logic Independently

Business logic should be testable without requiring:

- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Databases
- External APIs

Unit tests should focus on validating business behavior rather than infrastructure.

---

## Keep Infrastructure Stable

The architecture should remain consistent across every backend service.

As new services are created, developers should only replace the business domain while reusing the same engineering foundation.

This consistency allows every PPST-based project to feel familiar regardless of its business purpose.

---

## Phase 1 Summary

By the end of this section, the goals of PPST should be clear:

- Provide a reusable backend engineering foundation.
- Standardize architecture across multiple services.
- Separate business logic from infrastructure.
- Encourage clean, maintainable, and testable code.
- Allow developers to focus on solving business problems instead of rebuilding common infrastructure.

The following sections explain how PPST achieves these goals through its architecture, layers, request lifecycle, and engineering components.
